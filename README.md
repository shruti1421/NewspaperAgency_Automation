Newspaper Agency Automation software is a web application aimed at automating newspaper subscriptions and unifying the data on one platform. The general procedure for newspaper subscriptions has been either via phone call or a physical visit to the agency office. In this pandemic-hit world, the physical constraints forbid us from a physical visit and phone calls can often be a tedious procedure notwithstanding the possibility of missing out on some details during the verbal procedure. 

To ease the process for the customers and to simplify the subscription record management, we have come up with our website that gives a list of subscription choices of newspapers and magazines
